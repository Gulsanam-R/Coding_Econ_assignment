# Coding_Econ_assignment
Final assignment of Coding for Economists course
Python and Do files contain commands, functions and other manipulations used to demonstrate required learning outcomes. 
The overall project is not meaningful. Different csv, dta files are used. gdp and csv files are from the class, so I haven't uploaded them here again.
However, each subset of the project does work well. The codes work properly and generate the intended results.

#How to reproduce the work?

You can run the Python codes on Google Colab since they were written there. If you use other editor, you might introduce slight changes depending on differences.

Do file can be run on Stata. You might want to turn the commands in the remaining sections into comment while running particular parts of the code.
Section division might be done as per the comments in the do file.
